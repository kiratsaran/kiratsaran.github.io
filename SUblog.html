                <p class="mt-20">
                    Data science is a diverse field that uses statistical and computational techniques to draw insights from data. The field is interdisciplinary combining the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and computer science. A wide range of methodologies can be used to analyze, process, and interpret vast amounts of data in order to acquire insights in the form of trends, patterns, and correlations.<br>
                    <br>Making well-informed decisions based such insights is the aim of data science. To find patterns and extract insights, it entails gathering of data, cleaning, processing, analyzing, and visualizing data. Data science can be used in a variety of sectors such as marketing, finance, healthcare, transportation and many more.<br>
                    <br>It is important to have a solid foundation in math and statistics as well as programming, analytical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills. Also, data scientists need to be proficient in large data tools like Hadoop, Spark, and SQL and well-versed in languages like Python and R.<br>
                    <br>Data science is becoming more and more significant in our daily lives, and this influence is only going to increase as more businesses come to understand the value of data-driven decision-making.

                <h5 class="mb-3">What did I expect to learn in my Master's program with iSchool?</h5>
                <p class="mt-20">Knowledge of the core ideas and tools of data science to make data driven decisions, such as cleaning, visualizations, statistical inference, hypothesis testing, and modelling algorithms like regression, classification, clustering. Also, knowledge of basic practical uses and implementation of data science in a range of fields, including marketing, finance, and healthcare and many more. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>1.	Data mining approaches like collecting, wrangling, cleaning, storing, accessing data and visualization techniques using SQL and computer languages like R or Python.</b><br>
                    
                    It is necessary in Data Science to gather correct data to make predictions. If you end up working with data that is not accurate, it could lead to results that are drastic and not accurate. Cleaning the data is also very important like removing null values, duplicate rows or replacing null values with average of that feature. It might not always be the case depending on your analysis, but it is a vital step. Changing the format of certain columns like numerical encoding, using standard scalar to make all columns relatable on the same scale, etc for machine and models to better interpret our underlying data. Storing and accessing such cleaned and scaled data is also necessary to do further visual analysis. This in turn gives us more detailed knowledge of the data in hand. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>2.	Capability to analyze exploratory data, spot trends, recognize useful features and draw conclusions from large datasets.</b><br>
                    
                    A good way to dig into the data and get in depth knowledge is by doing visual analysis using Pyhton libraries like matplotlib, seaborn or R libraries like ggplot2. This helps us identify trends and patterns, feature frequency, relationship and association amongst features, outliers, data imbalances, correlations between features and identify anomalies if any in the underlying data. These details can simply not be identified by just taking a glance at the data. Visualizations can be in the form of histograms, scatter plots, box plots, correlation heat maps and many more. Different types of data and analysis need different visuals. Example: Categorical data is best represented in bar charts or pie charts whereas continuous data in histograms or density plots. All the information and insights that we gain from visual analysis is further used for further cleaning of data, if necessary, overcome any bias and for feature selection to build our analysis models.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>3.	Experience with machine learning methods such as Bayesian analysis, regression, decision trees and so on to generate predictive models and get actionable insights.</b><br>
                    
                    Courses in Syracuse University’s Applied Data Science program has given me the competence to understand the deliverable and decide on an approach to the predictive models to be built. It could be supervised, unsupervised or deep learning modelling approach. Depending on the approach you take different modelling algorithms can be used falling under the category of classification, regression, clustering, time series, etc. Multitude of models can be built depending on the category of modelling approach you take like logistic regression, k-neareast neighbors, decision tree classification for classification models. After building models using separate algorithms for your analysis, our best performing model can be identified using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and more. Our best performing model and its results can further be improved by using the concept of hyper-parameter tuning. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>4.	Understanding of good report writing including visualizations and presenting techniques.</b><br>
                    
                    In the duration of my Applied Data Science program, I have understood that it is very important to understand the audience you are presenting your project insights to. Not everyone understands all the technical terms and jargon. It is very important to convey your findings in a simple, concise, and precise way so that everyone in the audience can comprehend it. Focusing Visuals are one of the best ways to explain your insights. This needs to be implemented not only in presentations but in report writing as well.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>5.	Knowledge of the ethical and legal concerns surrounding data science, such as bias, privacy, transparency to subjects’ and data protection.</b><br>
                    
                    We as upcoming Data Scientists need to comply with privacy and data protection laws. Personal information or any other data belonging to any firm must be handled with care and precaution and must be only used for the purpose of our analysis. It shouldn’t be leaked consciously or unconsciously and so precautionary measures like good data management should be practiced to not cause any harm or chaos to our subjects. Data obtained for our analysis should be provided to us by our subject willingly. We should also ensure that our analysis and findings are transparent and explainable. We should provide clarity on how we collect data, where and for what purposes has that data been used, and what measures we take to protect our subjects’ data.

                        <p>1. The sheer amount and variety of data that I encountered. Data science is rapidly evolving, and the volume and complexity of data is growing exponentially. Sometimes the data I was working with was much larger and more complex than I had anticipated.<br>
                           <br>
                           2. Data science is interdisciplinary and requires expertise in mathematics, statistics, computer science, and domain-specific knowledge in areas such as healthcare, finance, and marketing. Need to develop expertise in multiple areas to be successful in the field.<br>
                           <br>
                           3. Importance of storytelling and communication skills. Data science is not just about analyzing data, but also about presenting findings in a way that is understandable and compelling to a non-technical audience. Need to develop strong communication skills to be able to effectively communicate findings to others.
